;;; Commentary:

;; Add package archives preferred by us:
;;
;; - gnu (the system default): https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/
;; - melpa: https://melpa.org/packages/
;; - marmalade: https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/
;;
;; Extra package archives could be configured:
;; - elpa: https://tromey.com/elpa/
;; - melpa-stable: https://stable.melpa.org/packages/
;; - elpy: https://jorgenschaefer.github.io/packages/

;; This module is automatically used when::
;;
;;     (require 'xorns)

;; Enjoy!
