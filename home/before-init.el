;;; Commentary:

;; All files in this directory are examples to be sym-linked or copied as base
;; in "~/.emacs.d/".  This one is a initialization file that runs before
;; `xorns'.

;; The name in "~/.emacs.d/" could be created like:
;;   $ ln -sf ~/work/src/xorns/home/before-init.el before-init-med.el

;; Enjoy!

;;; Code:

;; Remove "--group-directories-first" in Mac
;; '(dired-listing-switches "-l --group-directories-first -h")
