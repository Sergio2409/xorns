;; This file is a base template to generate the user-specific customization
;; file.  See `>>=user-config/load' function for more information.


;;; Code:

(defun >>=building-blocks/configuration ()
  "Initialization code for building-blocks configuration."
  (setq-default
    ;; It should only modify building-block setting-variables (those prefixed
    ;; with ">>=+") when their default values are not suitable for your
    ;; configuration.  For example:
    ; >>=+programming/extra-languages '(haskell ruby)
    ))


(defun >>=settings/init ()
  "Initialization code for user-settings customization."
  (setq-default
    ;; Called at the very beginning of the startup process, before building
    ;; blocks configuration.  It should only modify modify setting-variables
    ;; (those prefixed with ">>=|") when their default values are not suitable
    ;; for your configuration.  For example:
    ; >>=|enable-server nil
    ))


; This function is called immediately after `>>=settings/init', before
; building-blocks configuration.  It''s mostly for variables that should be
; set before package-system is loaded.
(defun >>=custom/user-init ()
  "User-code as part of initialization process."
  )


(defun >>=user-config ()
  "User-code after initialization process."
  )
