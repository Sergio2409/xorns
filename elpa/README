Merchise extensions for Emacs
=============================

"Xorns" provides routines and variables to use Emacs in a better way,
according to "Merchise Group" best practices and rules.

The name "Xorns" comes from "horns" as a metaphor because "Emacs" is the head
of the "Gnu" and "Xorns" the horns of that head.  The "X" is due to Merchise's
projects start with that letter looking for words in Nahuatl or those in
English sometimes replacing the "H" for the "X" like in this case.
