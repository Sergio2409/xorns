Merchise Xorns
==============

"Xorns" provides routines and variables to use Emacs in a better way,
according to "Merchise Group" best practices and rules.

The name "xorns" comes from "horns" as a metaphor in the sense that
"Emacs" is the head of the "GNU" and our framework would be "horns"
of that head.  The *X* instead the *H* is due to the name of all
Merchise projects start with that letter looking for words in Nahuatl
or sometimes in English replacing *H* by *X*.


Installation
------------

To install this package from `xorns-<version>.tar` follow standard
Emacs package installation.

If you have the *GIT repository*, then execute from the shell command
line::

    $ emacs --load=install.el --batch --debug

After the package is fully installed (with its all dependencies), just
configure one of the standard initialization files (`~/.emacs` or
`~/.emacs.d/init.el`) with the following body::

    (package-initialize)
    (require 'xorns nil 'noerror)

If you want to configure our preferred `package-archives`, include
also::

    (require 'xorns-package nil 'noerror)


Documentation
-------------

Right now, only is available the inner modules header commentaries.  But
we think that if you are installing this package, you are an advanced
Emacs user and probably (but not necessary) a nice programmer.  Then
will be enough to review our source code and hit sometimes `C-h f` or
`C-h v` to see Emacs documentation for functions and variables.
