;;; Commentary:

;; Basically requires hideshow and integrates with nxml


;;; Code:
(require 'hideshow)
(require 'sgml-mode)
(require 'nxml-mode)

(add-to-list 'hs-special-modes-alist
             '(nxml-mode
               "<!--\\|<[^/>]*[^/]>"
               "-->\\|</[^/>]*[^/]>"

               "<!--"
               sgml-skip-tag-forward
               nil))

(add-hook 'nxml-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode)

(define-key nxml-mode-map (kbd "C-c +") 'hs-toggle-hiding)

;;; xorns-xml.el ends here
