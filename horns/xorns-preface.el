;;; Commentary:

;; The visual initialization module is loaded first of all, even before
;; package system (`xorns-packages'), it is processed in two parts: preface
;; and epilogue.
;;
;; This is because there are visual features that need to be configured in the
;; first place, and other that would need a frame to be created, or some
;; packages loaded, in order to function accurately.
;;
;; There are some extra problems with the load order of some resources (like
;; the frame/fonts); for regular Emacs launches (non-daemon), are loaded
;; *before* the Emacs configuration is read; but when Emacs is launched as a
;; daemon (using emacsclient), the fonts are not actually loaded until the
;; hook `after-make-frame-functions' is run; but even at that point, the frame
;; is not yet selected (for the daemon case).  Without a selected frame, the
;; `find-font' will not work correctly!
;;
;; So we do the font setup in `focus-in-hook' instead, by which time in the
;; Emacs startup process, all of the below are true:
;;
;; - Fonts are loaded (in both daemon and non-daemon cases).
;;
;; - The frame is also selected, and so `find-font' calls work correctly.

;;
;; In the preface, the mode-line is hidden, useless-bars are removed, and the
;; coding-system is defined to UTF-8.
