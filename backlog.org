#+TITLE: Backlog for *Xorns* -  an improved way to use Emacs
#+AUTHOR: Merchise Autrement [~ยบ/~]
#+DESCRIPTION: Development planning for this package.

* Minor issues [/]

* Configuration [/]

- [ ] Configure ~ibuffer-saved-filter-groups~ incrementally.

  This is, each module will add its own group.  *xorns-buffers.el* will only
  configure generic modes.

  Plan a similar task for every variable that has parts dependable on specific
  stuffs in different modules.

- [ ] Create a *tagged* configuration system.

  That will allow to determine which features to load in a more precise way.
  See ~xorns-config-level~ function for more information on current actual
  implementation.
